#### Project Description: Impact of wolf presence on the diet of coyotes in Washington state using DNA metabarcoding with 12S V5 region

This project is looking at the interaction between wolf and coyotes and how this interaction will affect the diet of coyotes in the high-wolf density area and in the low-wolf denstiy area. The diet analyses will be done with DNA metabarcoding method using 12S V5 region. 

There are three directories in this repository and many subdirectories. Here is the structure: 
- Data
  - raw: forward (R1.fastq) and reverse (R2.fastq) reads; 
  - filt: filtered sequence data after removing bad alignments, dereplicates, remove singletons, remove bad PCR and remove contaminants; 
  - taxo: taxonomy classified sequences; 

- Scripts
  - filter.txt
  - taxon.txt

- Analyses
  - not sure yet; 
 
 #### Timeline
 
 - Week 4: directory organization and high-throughput taxonomy classification with command line; 
 - Week 5: preliminary ecological analyses with test data;
